# Testcase Example:  '"heeellooo"\n["hello", "hi", "helo"]'
#
# Sometimes people repeat letters to represent extra feeling. For
# example:
# 
# 
# "hello" -> "heeellooo"
# "hi" -> "hiiii"
# 
# 
# In these strings like "heeellooo", we have groups of adjacent letters that
# are all the same: "h", "eee", "ll", "ooo".
# 
# You are given a string s and an array of query strings words. A query word is
# stretchy if it can be made to be equal to s by any number of applications of
# the following extension operation: choose a group consisting of characters c,
# and add some number of characters c to the group so that the size of the
# group is three or more.
# 
# 
# For example, starting with "hello", we could do an extension on the group "o"
# to get "hellooo", but we cannot get "helloo" since the group "oo" has a size
# less than three. Also, we could do another extension like "ll" -> "lllll" to
# get "helllllooo". If s = "helllllooo", then the query word "hello" would be
# stretchy because of these two extension operations: query = "hello" ->
# "hellooo" -> "helllllooo" = s.
# 
# 
# Return the number of query strings that are stretchy.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "heeellooo", words = ["hello", "hi", "helo"]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: 
# We can extend "e" and "o" in the word "hello" to get "heeellooo".
# We can't extend "helo" to get "heeellooo" because the group "ll" is not size
# 3 or more.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "zzzzzyyyyy", words = ["zzyy","zy","zyy"]
# Output: 3
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= s.length, words.length <= 100
# 1 <= words[i].length <= 100
# s and words[i] consist of lowercase letters.
